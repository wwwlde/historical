# My University Code Archive âœ¨  

A cozy little corner where I keep the code from my university daysâ€”projects, experiments, and just dear-to-the-heart junk from my past. Some of it might be rough around the edges, some might be surprisingly decent, but all of it is a part of my journey.  

Feel free to browse, laugh, learn, or cringe with me. ðŸš€
