# **A Journey Through My Computers**

> It's bad when a person is stuck in the past.

Every computer I‚Äôve owned tells a story‚Äîa snapshot of a different time in my life, filled with childhood gaming sessions, late-night Linux tinkering, and eventually, professional sysadmin work. But this journey isn‚Äôt just about hardware and specs. It‚Äôs about the experiences, the challenges, and the passion that shaped my path in tech.

From my first modest setup in the early 2000s to building high-performance rigs, experimenting with Linux, and eventually stepping into the Apple ecosystem, each machine has left its mark.

So, let‚Äôs take a nostalgic dive into the machines that defined my computing journey! üöÄ

## **My First Computer (~1999-2000)**

I‚Äôll never forget my first computer. It was a **birthday gift in 1999**, and at the time, it felt like pure magic. Huge thanks to my parents for making it happen! Back then, computers weren‚Äôt as common in every household as they are today, so having my own felt incredibly special.

Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt have any digital photos from that period, but from memory (and some research), the configuration looked something like this:

| **Specification** | **Details**       |
|------------------|------------------|
| **Motherboard** | Soltek SL-65FVB   |
| **CPU**         | Celeron 800 MHz   |
| **RAM**         | 128 MB            |
| **Storage**     | 20 GB             |
| **Graphics**    | Nvidia Riva TNT2  |

_The Soltek SL-65FVB ‚Äì my first motherboard._

It wasn‚Äôt exactly a powerhouse, but for its time, it was more than capable. I wasn‚Äôt a hardcore gamer, but a few classics like *Max Payne*, *Quake III*, *Red Alert II*, and *Majesty* left a lasting impression on me.

_Even today, I‚Äôd still dive into *Max Payne* without hesitation._

I experimented a lot with this machine, trying out different operating systems‚Äîeverything from *Windows 95*, *Windows 98*, *Windows ME* (*we all know how that went...*), *Windows 2000*, and *Windows XP* to my first steps in Linux with **Red Hat Linux 6** and **Mandrake Linux**.

_My first Linux distro ‚Äì and the start of my love for UNIX-based systems._

By early 2004, I started feeling that my current machine was no longer keeping up. Modern operating systems were sluggish, and using the computer just didn‚Äôt feel as smooth as it once did. It was becoming clear that an upgrade was inevitable.  

After crunching the numbers and checking my savings, I decided it was time for a new computer. With university on the horizon, it seemed like the perfect opportunity to invest in something more capable‚Äîsomething that could handle both my studies and my growing interest in technology.

## **Upgrade 2004 - 2006**

Before starting university, I decided to invest in a proper upgrade. With some savings and a bit of help from my parents, I got my hands on a machine that felt like a **real** step forward:

| **Component**  | **Specification**                   |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Motherboard** | ASUS A8N-SLI Deluxe             |
| **CPU**        | AMD Athlon 64 X2 4800+           |
| **RAM**        | 4GB                               |
| **Storage**    | 200GB SATA + 120GB IDE (external) |
| **Graphics**   | GeForce 6600 GT (if memory serves) |

The motherboard was a **beast**, packed with everything I could have possibly wanted at the time‚Äîspeed, power, and expandability.

I even found an old photo from that era:

This system ran **Windows XP** alongside **Mandrake Linux** on a separate partition. The case was a personal favorite‚Äîit had an **info panel displaying system stats** and was built like a tank, with solid metal construction.

## **University Years (2006 - 2012)**

_My room_

By my second year of university, I landed a part-time job at a **local ISP**. My tasks ranged from pulling network cables (**fun, but sometimes risky!**) to configuring routers. Over time, I worked my way up and became a **junior under the lead sysadmin**‚Äîa true guru. Those were golden years.

Balancing work and studies wasn‚Äôt easy, but I managed to graduate with a **Master‚Äôs degree, earning a red diploma with honors**. My boss at the time joked that I should frame it and hang it in the restroom‚Äîhis way of emphasizing the "real-world value" of higher education. (Ironically, he had dropped out of university himself.)

But to make that happen, I had to make a tough choice‚ÄîI quit my part-time job and fully dedicated myself to my studies. It wasn‚Äôt easy, but I knew it was the right move for the long run.  

Then, at the beginning of my fourth year at university, an incredible opportunity came my way‚Äîa chance to join a major European hosting company. It felt like a dream job, and I knew I had to give it my all. I put everything I had into the interview, prepared meticulously, and did my absolute best. And in the end, it paid off‚ÄîI got the job!

In 2009, I took another big step, joining **WebZilla** as a support engineer. I spent almost **six years** there, and it became the period of my **greatest professional growth** as an engineer.

WebZilla specialized in **managed hosting solutions**, running primarily on **FreeBSD**. Working there meant diving deep into UNIX fundamentals‚Äîcompiling software from source, optimizing performance, and maintaining large-scale infrastructure. I loved it so much that I even set up a **personal FreeBSD home server** to experiment and push my skills further.

During this period, I also upgraded my hardware again. My last **‚Äúparent-funded‚Äù** device was an **ASUS laptop**, which originally came with **Windows Vista** (*ugh*), but I quickly replaced it with **Windows XP** and later **Ubuntu**.

The desktop PC below was **the first computer I bought entirely with my own money**.

![My desktop PC](./images/screenshot-17.jpg)

It was a solid gaming machine at the time, powered by a **Radeon HD 5750**. Incredibly, that same **GPU is still alive today**, running in my nephew‚Äôs PC in Lithuania.

| **Component**  | **Specification**                   |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Motherboard** | ASUS M3N78-VM                   |
| **CPU**        | AMD Athlon 64 X2 7750            |
| **RAM**        | 8GB                              |
| **Storage**    | 250GB SATA + 250GB SATA (Mirror) |
|                | 200GB SATA (Ubuntu)              |
| **Graphics**   | ASUS Radeon HD5750 1024MB 128 bit Formula |

It ran **Windows XP** alongside **Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn)**, a combination that felt both practical and exciting at the time.

![Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn)](./images/screenshot-5.jpg)

I was also a proud owner of a **collection of Ubuntu CD releases**, carefully collecting each version all the way up to **Ubuntu 12.04**. Unfortunately, due to the war, those discs were lost‚Äîa small but meaningful piece of my tech history that I wish I still had.

By my fifth year, netbooks were all the rage, and I got an **Asus Eee PC 1101HA**. It was compact, lightweight, and ran **Linux** smoothly‚Äîthough getting **GMA500 graphics** working properly required some patience.

## **The Beginning of My Apple Era (2012 - Present) üòú**

After years of custom-built PCs and UNIX-based systems, I started looking for **a UNIX OS with better hardware integration and a polished UI**. That‚Äôs when I gave **macOS** a try.

|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| ![Mac mini](./images/macmini/IMG_0921.JPG) | ![Mac mini](./images/macmini/IMG_0924.JPG) |

My first step into the Apple ecosystem was **a Mac mini**, and I instantly fell in love with it. Over time, I upgraded through several Macs, including:

  * ‚úÖ **MacBook Air 2017**
  * ‚úÖ **MacBook Pro 2021 (Touch Bar version)**
  * ‚úÖ **MacBook 2016** (my trusty travel companion, replacing my old Eee PC)

And now? I‚Äôm running a **Mac mini 2024 with an M4 chip and 32GB of RAM**‚Äîan **absolute beast** in a compact form factor.

_An amazing machine!_

I‚Äôve always loved **quiet, powerful, and efficient computers**, and I hope this one stays with me for a long time.

## **Conclusion: More Than Just Machines**

Looking back, this journey through my computers is not just about hardware‚Äîit‚Äôs about the **lessons, challenges, and experiences that shaped me**.

From my first Celeron-powered rig to a powerful M4 Mac, from experimenting with Linux as a kid to working with UNIX professionally, my passion for technology has only grown stronger.

And even now, I can‚Äôt wait to see **what‚Äôs next**. üöÄ
