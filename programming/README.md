# Algorithm Descriptions

This repository contains implementations of two algorithms:

1. [Banker's Algorithm](banker/) — a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm used in operating systems.
2. [Huffman Coding](huffman/) — a lossless data compression algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to characters based on their frequencies.
